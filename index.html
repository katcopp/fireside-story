      <p>It was a dark and stormy night... when the alien broke into the bakery.</p>
      <p>He was thankful that some of the inhabitants of this planet were into tasty desserts unlike his host family who kept feeding him seaweed.</p>
      <p>He went for the eclairs first and midway through gobbling the massive stack of chocolate glazed goodness, he heard the low growl of the beast from the darkness of the kitchen.</p>
      <p>He stuffed one more eclair into his mouth as he ran to the kitchen.</p>
